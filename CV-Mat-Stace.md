## Work Experience

### [7digital][], London, UK

#### System Administrator - June 2011 to present

My role at 7digital is that of a generalist system administrator. I'm linux focussed, with exposure to windows, and am involved in the full life-cycle of servers (physical and virtual), from procurement, through designing and deploying systems, to monitoring and day to day maintenance. The system administrators deal with product and system-level tickets from colleagues, and work with the development teams to improve both internal systems, and public facing platforms.

As you can see from the list below, I have exposure to a wide and varied range of technologies and systems. 
Operating Systems: Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Solaris, Windows.
Technologies, applications, etc: Apache, Nginx, Varnish, HAProxy, MySQL, Memcache, Logstash, Bind, PowerDNS, Exim, Postfix, Sendmail, Proftpd, Zabbix, KVM, ESXi, Samba, Subversion, Git, Bacula


### [Research Now][], London, UK

#### Unix Administrator and Postmaster - November 2010 to June 2011

While at Research Now, my time was spent building, deploying, and maintaining a new email infrastructure, for a system which sent between four and five million emails per day. This was achieved using Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and PowerMTA for the outbound emails, and exim/ClamAV for the incoming email servers.


### [Distilled][], London, UK

#### System Administrator - January 2010 to November 2010

#### Developer - October 2008 to November 2010

I originally joined Distilled as a LAMP web application developer, but when the system administrator left, I took on this role in addition to my web development work. As the sole system administrator for a small agency, this work covered everything from comissioning and maintaining servers, through office intranets and phone systems, to desktop support for a non-homogeneous Windows, Linux, and Mac environment. The servers were a mix of Debian, Ubuntu, and CentOS, and the technology stack included (but was not limited to) Apache, Varnish, NGinx, MySQL


### [Colewood Internet][], Essex, UK

#### Developer - March 2004 to September 2008

Although my role at Colewood was that of web application developer (using the LAMP stack), Colewood was a company of three people, and as "the techie one", I also dealt with the servers (although we used a semi-managed hosting solution, so there was a lot of hand holding from the hosting companies we used). In addition to the LAMP development and dealing with servers, I also designed and built a VoIP system based on Asterisk, with the dual objectives of reducing the money spent with BT, and also allowing the creation of a virtual office, to allow remote working.
