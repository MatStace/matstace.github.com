### [7digital][], London, UK

#### Web Operations Engineer - June 2011 to June 2014

Part of a team of web operations engineers working in an agile/devops environment, who are responsible for running the infrastructure which powers the company's web applications stacks, including traditional websites, APIs, and streaming media delivery, across a heterogeneous environment of physical and virtual linux and windows servers, using both KVM and VMWare ESXi for virtualisation.

My projects included leading the successful build and roll out of a new logging platform, based around the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), and working as part of a team to bring a test-driven approach to the deployment and configuration of various infrastructure components, using Jenkins, Vagrant, bats, and Serverspec.

Technologies supported include Windows servers running IIS, Nginx, and MSSQL, and both Debian and Red Hat based linux servers running a wide range of services and daemons, including Apache, Nginx, HAProxy, Varnish, MySQL, Memcached, Redis, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Bacula, PowerDNS, Exim, Postfix, Sendmail, Zabbix, Statsd, Graphite, ProFTPd, and KVM and VMWare ESXi for virtualisation. We use CFEngine, and have also evaluated Chef and Puppet.


### [Research Now][], London, UK

#### Unix Administrator and Postmaster - November 2010 to June 2011

While at Research Now, my time was spent building, deploying, and maintaining a new email infrastructure, for a system which sent between four and five million emails per day. This was achieved using Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and PowerMTA for the outbound emails, and exim/ClamAV for the incoming email servers.


### [Distilled][], London, UK

#### System Administrator - January 2010 to November 2010

#### Developer - October 2008 to November 2010

I originally joined Distilled as a LAMP web application developer, but when the system administrator left, I took on this role in addition to my web development work. As the sole system administrator for a small agency, this work covered everything from commissioning and maintaining servers, through office intranets and phone systems, to desktop support for a heterogeneous Windows, Linux, and Mac environment. The servers were a mix of Debian, Ubuntu, and CentOS, and the technology stack included (but was not limited to) Apache, Varnish, NGinx, MySQL


### [Colewood Internet][], Essex, UK

#### Developer - March 2004 to September 2008

Although my role at Colewood was that of web application developer (using the LAMP stack), Colewood was a company of three people, and as "the techie one", I also dealt with the servers (although we used a semi-managed hosting solution, so there was a lot of hand holding from the hosting companies we used). In addition to the LAMP development and dealing with servers, I also designed and built a VoIP system based on Asterisk, with the dual objectives of reducing the operating expenditure with BT, and also allowing the creation of a virtual office, to begin the transition to remote working.
