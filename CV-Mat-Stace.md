## Work Experience

### [7digital][], London, UK

#### System Administrator/Web Operations Engineer - June 2011 to present

I am part of a team of web operations engineers who are responsible for the day to day running of the infrastructure that powers the company's web applications stacks, which include traditional websites, APIs, and streaming media delivery. This encompases all steps from hardware procurement, physical installation, configuration, day to day management, and troubleshooting and repair. Due to the nature of the work, we are expected to be comfortable working in different styles, from individual, self-motivated projects, up to large cross-team projects with product owners and project managers, with inspiration being drawn from the DevOps movement to further improve the company culture and inter-departmental communication.

The web application stack includes both Windows servers running IIS, Nginx, and MSSQL, and both Debian and Red Hat based linux servers running a wide range of services and daemons, including Apache, Nginx, HAProxy, Varnish, MySQL, Memcached, Bacula, PowerDNS, Exim, Postfix, Sendmail, Zabbix, Statsd, Graphite, ProFTPd, and KVM and VMWare ESXi for virtualisation.


### [Research Now][], London, UK

#### Unix Administrator and Postmaster - November 2010 to June 2011

While at Research Now, my time was spent building, deploying, and maintaining a new email infrastructure, for a system which sent between four and five million emails per day. This was achieved using Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and PowerMTA for the outbound emails, and exim/ClamAV for the incoming email servers.


### [Distilled][], London, UK

#### System Administrator - January 2010 to November 2010

#### Developer - October 2008 to November 2010

I originally joined Distilled as a LAMP web application developer, but when the system administrator left, I took on this role in addition to my web development work. As the sole system administrator for a small agency, this work covered everything from comissioning and maintaining servers, through office intranets and phone systems, to desktop support for a heterogeneous Windows, Linux, and Mac environment. The servers were a mix of Debian, Ubuntu, and CentOS, and the technology stack included (but was not limited to) Apache, Varnish, NGinx, MySQL


### [Colewood Internet][], Essex, UK

#### Developer - March 2004 to September 2008

Although my role at Colewood was that of web application developer (using the LAMP stack), Colewood was a company of three people, and as "the techie one", I also dealt with the servers (although we used a semi-managed hosting solution, so there was a lot of hand holding from the hosting companies we used). In addition to the LAMP development and dealing with servers, I also designed and built a VoIP system based on Asterisk, with the dual objectives of reducing the operating expenditure with BT, and also allowing the creation of a virtual office, to begin the transition to remote working.

## Hobbies and Other Interests

Outside of work I like to keep up to date with a wide range of technology news (that is the polite way of saying that I am a bit of a gadget hound), and when I do manage to tear myself away from the various technology blogs, I like to listen to music, play bass guitar (badly), and I am a recent convert to the world of running, so I am also spending plenty of time attempting to get fit enough to run a half marathon.
