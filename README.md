# My CV, Made in Markdown, Hosted on Github

This is [Philip J. Hollenback](http://twitter.com/philiph)'s fault. He wrote an article for SysAdvent in 2011 title "[Write Your Resume in Markdown Already!](http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-14-write-your-resume-in-markdown.html)".

The last time I had to update my CV, I had a load of hassle trying to deal with an old microsoft word doc, and ended up re-doing the whole thing from scratch in google docs, and even then, I wasn't happy with it.

So I've totally taken inspiration from Philip's SysAdvent piece, and redone (well, am re-doing) my CV in markdown.

Through that article, I also discovered github pages (hello out there, what's it like when you don't live under a rock?), so used this as an excuse to actually put something on github pages, to see how it works.
