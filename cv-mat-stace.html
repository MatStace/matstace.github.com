<p>I originally joined Distilled as a LAMP web application developer, but when the system administrator left, I took on this role in addition to my web development work. As the sole system administrator for a small agency, this work covered everything from commissioning and maintaining servers, through office intranets and phone systems, to desktop support for a heterogeneous Windows, Linux, and Mac environment. The servers were a mix of Debian, Ubuntu, and CentOS, and the technology stack included (but was not limited to) Apache, Varnish, NGinx, MySQL</p>

<h4 id="developer---march-2004-to-september-2008">Developer - March 2004 to September 2008</h4>
<p>Although my role at Colewood was that of web application developer (using the LAMP stack), Colewood was a company of three people, and as “the techie one”, I also dealt with the servers (although we used a semi-managed hosting solution, so there was a lot of hand holding from the hosting companies we used). In addition to the LAMP development and dealing with servers, I also designed and built a VoIP system based on Asterisk, with the dual objectives of reducing the operating expenditure with BT, and also allowing the creation of a virtual office, to begin the transition to remote working.</p>
